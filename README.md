# Leaflet, React, Typescript Module bundled with Webpack

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Add typescript files to ```src``` folder. The entry point of the module is ```App.tsx``` so make sure your new modules are imported into that.
3. Run ```npm run start``` to start the webpack dev server. This allows for hot reloading and building of the app. 
4. To build the production version, run ```npm run build:prod```. This minifies and handles all of the bundling ready for a production build.
